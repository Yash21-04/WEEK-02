# Project Name - Lane Detection using OpenCV

This project implements a lane detection system using Python and OpenCV. The pipeline processes images or video streams from a vehicle-mounted camera to detect lane lines on roads. Key steps include color selection, edge detection with Canny, defining a region of interest, and applying Hough Transform to identify lane boundaries. This system simulates foundational aspects of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for autonomous driving and driver safety.
